                <h3>Early life</h3>
                <p>Alfred was born on August 2, 1985, in Toledo City, Cebu, Philippines. He is the fifth of seven children of Filipino parents Alberto Odtojan Reambonanza and Aida Fabro Reambonanza. His family and friends call him "Augie" (O-gi). The nickname was from his birth month, August. Like any other normal kid, he is active outdoors despite his seasonal asthma. He went to La Salle Don Andres Soriano during his elementary years. He finished his secondary education at Don Andres Soriano National High School in 2003. Alfred did not grow up to be privileged. Among his siblings, he is the only one who graduated from a public school during his secondary education due to the financial crisis his family experienced. Alfred then went to a public college to finish his Associate's degree in Aircraft Maintenance. He may be unlucky financially, but he is very fortunate regarding his friends. Alfred enjoys the outdoors and loves spending time with his long-time friends from high school. He loves trekking for long hours to the mountains and camping overnight, rock climbing, swimming, fishing, playing basketball, karaoke, singing, and playing guitar. Until now, they would get together once in a while.</p>
